Credit Risk Prediction:

This project, developed as a team, focuses on using machine learning to predict credit risk for financial institutions, helping them assess the likelihood of lending to potential borrowers.

Project Overview:

We utilized a dataset containing attributes such as loan amount, employment length, and the percentage of income dedicated to loan repayments. The process involved:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

We handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
Model Selection: We implemented multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.
Evaluation Metrics: Models were assessed using accuracy, AUC, and ROC curves to determine their performance.
Key Results
The top-performing models were Random Forest and XGBoost, with the highest accuracy and AUC scores, showing their potential in predicting credit risk.
Bar charts and ROC curves demonstrate the models' performance and trade-offs in prediction.
Challenges & Future Work
We encountered challenges in handling categorical data and maintaining consistency across models. Future improvements may include exploring feature engineering and deep learning models to capture more complex patterns in the data.

Thank you for exploring our project. We hope it provides valuable insights into using machine learning for credit risk prediction!
